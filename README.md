# Code Walkthrough

Welcome to the detailed walkthrough of the Audio Playback application code! This guide is designed for beginners and will explain each line of the code clearly and thoroughly. Let’s dive in!

## Imports

```vb
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices
Imports System.Text
Imports System.IO
```

- **Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices**: This namespace is used to enable interaction with unmanaged code, particularly for calling functions from Windows DLLs.
- **Imports System.Text**: This namespace provides classes for manipulating strings, including `StringBuilder`, which is used for building strings efficiently.
- **Imports System.IO**: This namespace contains classes for handling input and output, especially for file operations.

## Class Definition

```vb
Public Class Form1
```

- This line defines a public class named `Form1`. This is the main form of the application where all functionalities will be implemented.

## DllImport Attribute

```vb
<DllImport("winmm.dll", EntryPoint:="mciSendStringW")>
Private Shared Function mciSendStringW(<MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPTStr)> ByVal lpszCommand As String,
                                       <MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)> ByVal lpszReturnString As StringBuilder,
                                       ByVal cchReturn As UInteger, ByVal hwndCallback As IntPtr) As Integer
End Function
```

- **<DllImport("winmm.dll", EntryPoint:="mciSendStringW")>**: This attribute allows us to call the `mciSendStringW` function from the `winmm.dll`, which is a Windows Multimedia API function used for controlling multimedia playback.
- **Private Shared Function mciSendStringW(...)**: This declares a function that will send commands to the multimedia API.
  - **lpszCommand**: The command string to execute.
  - **lpszReturnString**: A `StringBuilder` to hold any return string from the command.
  - **cchReturn**: The size of the return string.
  - **hwndCallback**: A handle to a window for receiving notifications.

## Sound Array Declaration

```vb
Private Sounds() As String
```

- This line declares an array called `Sounds` that will hold the names of the audio files being managed.

## Form Load Event

```vb
Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
```

- This subroutine runs when the form is loaded. It initializes the application.

### Setting the Title

```vb
Text = "Audio Playback - Code with Joe"
```

- This sets the title of the form to "Audio Playback - Code with Joe".

### Creating Sound Files

```vb
CreateSoundFileFromResource()
```

- This calls a method to create sound files from resources if they do not already exist.

### Adding Sounds

```vb
Dim FilePath As String = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "level.mp3")
AddSound("Music", FilePath)
SetVolume("Music", 600)
```

- **Dim FilePath**: This creates a string variable `FilePath` that combines the startup path of the application with the filename `level.mp3`.
- **AddSound("Music", FilePath)**: This adds the sound file with the alias "Music".
- **SetVolume("Music", 600)**: This sets the volume of the "Music" sound to 600 (on a scale of 0 to 1000).

### Adding Overlapping Sounds

```vb
FilePath = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "CashCollected.mp3")
AddOverlapping("CashCollected", FilePath)
SetVolumeOverlapping("CashCollected", 900)
LoopSound("Music")
```

- This repeats the process for another sound file, `CashCollected.mp3`, adding it with overlapping capabilities and setting its volume to 900.
- **LoopSound("Music")**: This starts looping the "Music" sound.

## Button Click Events

### Play Overlapping Sounds

```vb
Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    PlayOverlapping("CashCollected")
End Sub
```

- This method plays the overlapping sound "CashCollected" when Button1 is clicked.

### Toggle Music Looping

```vb
Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click
    If IsPlaying("Music") = True Then
        PauseSound("Music")
        Button2.Text = "Play Loop"
    Else
        LoopSound("Music")
        Button2.Text = "Pause Loop"
    End If
End Sub
```

- This method checks if "Music" is currently playing. If it is, it pauses the sound and changes the button text to "Play Loop". If not, it starts looping the sound and changes the button text to "Pause Loop".

## Form Closing Event

```vb
Private Sub Form1_Closing(sender As Object, e As System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs) Handles MyBase.Closing
    CloseSounds()
End Sub
```

- This method is called when the form is closing. It ensures that all sounds are properly closed before the application exits.

## Adding a Sound

```vb
Private Function AddSound(SoundName As String, FilePath As String) As Boolean
```

- This function attempts to add a sound file to the application.

### Checking Conditions

```vb
If Not String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SoundName) AndAlso IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then
```

- This checks if the `SoundName` is not empty and if the file exists at the specified path.

### Opening the Sound File

```vb
Dim CommandOpen As String = $"open ""{FilePath}"" alias {SoundName}"
Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)
```

- This constructs a command string to open the sound file with an alias and initializes a `StringBuilder` for any return data.

### Sound Management Logic

```vb
If Sounds IsNot Nothing Then
    If Not Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then
        If mciSendStringW(CommandOpen, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then
            Array.Resize(Sounds, Sounds.Length + 1)
            Sounds(Sounds.Length - 1) = SoundName
            Return True
        End If
    End If
Else
    If mciSendStringW(CommandOpen, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then
        ReDim Sounds(0)
        Sounds(0) = SoundName
        Return True
    End If
End If
```

- This block checks if the `Sounds` array is initialized and whether the sound is already in the array. If not, it tries to open the sound file using `mciSendStringW`. If successful, it resizes the `Sounds` array and adds the new sound.

### Final Return Statement

```vb
Return False
```

- If the sound could not be added, the function returns `False`.

## Set Volume Function

```vb
Private Function SetVolume(SoundName As String, Level As Integer) As Boolean
```

- This function sets the volume for a specified sound.

### Volume Checking Logic

```vb
If Sounds IsNot Nothing Then
    If Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then
        If Level >= 0 AndAlso Level <= 1000 Then
```

- This checks if the `Sounds` array contains the specified sound and if the provided volume level is within the valid range (0 to 1000).

### Setting the Volume

```vb
Dim CommandVolume As String = $"setaudio {SoundName} volume to {Level}"
Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

If mciSendStringW(CommandVolume, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero) = 0 Then
    Return True
End If
```

- This constructs a command to set the audio volume and checks if the command was successful.

### Final Return Statement

```vb
Return False
```

- If the volume could not be set, the function returns `False`.

## Loop Sound Function

```vb
Private Function LoopSound(SoundName As String) As Boolean
```

- This function loops a specified sound.

### Sound Existence Check

```vb
If Sounds IsNot Nothing Then
    If Not Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then
        Return False
    End If
```

- This checks if the `Sounds` array is initialized and if the sound is present. If not, it returns `False`.

### Looping Logic

```vb
Dim CommandSeekToStart As String = $"seek {SoundName} to start"
Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

mciSendStringW(CommandSeekToStart, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero)

Dim CommandPlayRepete As String = $"play {SoundName} repeat"
If mciSendStringW(CommandPlayRepete, ReturnString, 0, Me.Handle) <> 0 Then
    Return False
End If
```

- This constructs commands to seek the sound to the start and play it in a loop. If the command fails, it returns `False`.

### Final Return Statement

```vb
Return True
```

- If the sound is successfully set to loop, the function returns `True`.

## Play Sound Function

```vb
Private Function PlaySound(SoundName As String) As Boolean
```

- This function plays a specified sound.

### Sound Existence Check

```vb
If Sounds IsNot Nothing Then
    If Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then
```

- This checks if the sound exists in the `Sounds` array.

### Playing Logic

```vb
Dim CommandSeekToStart As String = $"seek {SoundName} to start"
Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

mciSendStringW(CommandSeekToStart, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero)

Dim CommandPlay As String = $"play {SoundName} notify"
If mciSendStringW(CommandPlay, ReturnString, 0, Me.Handle) = 0 Then
    Return True
End If
```

- This seeks the sound to the start and plays it. If successful, it returns `True`.

### Final Return Statement

```vb
Return False
```

- If the sound could not be played, the function returns `False`.

## Pause Sound Function

```vb
Private Function PauseSound(SoundName As String) As Boolean
```

- This function pauses a specified sound.

### Sound Existence Check

```vb
If Sounds IsNot Nothing Then
    If Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then
```

- This checks if the sound exists in the `Sounds` array.

### Pausing Logic

```vb
Dim CommandPause As String = $"pause {SoundName} notify"
Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

If mciSendStringW(CommandPause, ReturnString, 0, Me.Handle) = 0 Then
    Return True
End If
```

- This constructs a command to pause the sound. If successful, it returns `True`.

### Final Return Statement

```vb
Return False
```

- If the sound could not be paused, the function returns `False`.

## Is Playing Function

```vb
Private Function IsPlaying(SoundName As String) As Boolean
    Return GetStatus(SoundName, "mode") = "playing"
End Function
```

- This function checks if a specified sound is currently playing by calling `GetStatus` with the status type "mode".

## Adding Overlapping Sounds

```vb
Private Sub AddOverlapping(SoundName As String, FilePath As String)
```

- This method adds multiple instances of a sound file for overlapping playback.

### Loop Through Suffixes

```vb
For Each Suffix As String In {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L"}
    AddSound(SoundName & Suffix, FilePath)
Next
```

- This loops through a set of suffixes and adds the sound file with each suffix to allow multiple overlapping sounds.

## Playing Overlapping Sounds

```vb
Private Sub PlayOverlapping(SoundName As String)
```

- This method plays an overlapping sound.

### Loop Through Suffixes

```vb
For Each Suffix As String In {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L"}
    If Not IsPlaying(SoundName & Suffix) Then
        PlaySound(SoundName & Suffix)
        Exit Sub
    End If
Next
```

- This checks each suffix to see if the sound is already playing. If it finds one that isn’t, it plays that sound and exits the loop.

## Setting Volume for Overlapping Sounds













```vb
Private Sub SetVolumeOverlapping(SoundName As String, Level As Integer)
```

- This method sets the volume for multiple overlapping sound instances.

### Loop Through Suffixes

```vb
For Each Suffix As String In {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L"}
    SetVolume(SoundName & Suffix, Level)
Next
```

- This loops through each suffix and calls the `SetVolume` method to set the specified volume level for each overlapping instance of the sound.

## Getting Sound Status

```vb
Private Function GetStatus(SoundName As String, StatusType As String) As String
```

- This function retrieves the status of a specified sound.

### Sound Existence Check

```vb
If Sounds IsNot Nothing Then
    If Sounds.Contains(SoundName) Then
```

- This checks if the `Sounds` array is initialized and contains the specified sound.

### Command to Get Status

```vb
Dim CommandStatus As String = $"status {SoundName} {StatusType}"
Dim StatusReturn As New StringBuilder(128)

mciSendStringW(CommandStatus, StatusReturn, 128, IntPtr.Zero)

Return StatusReturn.ToString.Trim.ToLower
```

- This constructs a command to get the status of the sound and stores the result in `StatusReturn`. It then returns the status as a trimmed lowercase string.

### Final Return Statement

```vb
Return String.Empty
```

- If the sound is not found, it returns an empty string.

## Closing Sounds

```vb
Private Sub CloseSounds()
```

- This method ensures that all sounds are closed when the application is exiting.

### Loop Through Sounds

```vb
If Sounds IsNot Nothing Then
    For Each Sound In Sounds
        Dim CommandClose As String = $"close {Sound}"
        Dim ReturnString As New StringBuilder(128)

        mciSendStringW(CommandClose, ReturnString, 0, IntPtr.Zero)
    Next
End If
```

- This checks if there are any sounds and loops through each sound in the `Sounds` array, sending a close command to the multimedia API to free up resources.

## Creating Sound Files from Resources

```vb
Private Sub CreateSoundFileFromResource()
```

- This method creates sound files from embedded resources if they do not already exist.

### Check and Write Level Sound

```vb
Dim FilePath As String = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "level.mp3")
If Not IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then
    IO.File.WriteAllBytes(FilePath, My.Resources.level)
End If
```

- This checks if the `level.mp3` file exists in the application’s startup path. If it does not exist, it writes the sound data from resources to that file.

### Check and Write Cash Collected Sound

```vb
FilePath = Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "CashCollected.mp3")
If Not IO.File.Exists(FilePath) Then
    IO.File.WriteAllBytes(FilePath, My.Resources.CashCollected)
End If
```

- This repeats the process for `CashCollected.mp3`, ensuring that both sound files are available for playback.
