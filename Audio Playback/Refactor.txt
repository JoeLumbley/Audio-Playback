### Changes Made:
1. **Error Handling**: Added `Try...Catch` blocks in the `SendMciCommand` function to handle exceptions.
2. **Resource Management**: Ensured proper resource management using the `Using` statement.
3. **Refactoring**: Introduced the `SendMciCommand` helper function to avoid code repetition.
4. **Readability**: Added comments and organized the code using `#Region...#End Region`.
5. **UI Feedback**: Updated button text based on play/pause state.
6. **Asynchronous Operations**: Could be considered in future updates for playing and loading sounds to keep the UI responsive.

Feel free to ask for any more adjustments or improvements!
